#
# Runs in Git Bash on Windows, and on Linux as well, where .NET cross-publishes the same build. The
# installer needs Inno Setup's compiler, which only runs on Windows, so a Linux run passes
# --no-installer and builds the zip alone. Without that flag a missing compiler is an error rather
# than a quietly smaller release.
#
# Neither is single-file, unlike the Linux tarball. With the native libraries bundled, a single-file
# build unpacks some 40 MB into %TEMP% on its first launch, which is slow and exactly the behaviour
# that antivirus software distrusts; a folder in a zip is what Windows users expect anyway.
